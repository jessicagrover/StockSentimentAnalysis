The "Stock Sentiment Analysis using News Headlines" project aims to predict stock price movements based on news headlines. It involves preprocessing a dataset containing news headlines and corresponding labels indicating whether the stock price increased (1) or decreased (0) on a given day. The data is split into training and testing sets, with headlines converted to lowercase and combined into paragraphs for each record. CountVectorizer is utilized to convert text data into numerical format, and a Random Forest classifier is trained on the training dataset. The trained model is then used to predict stock price movements on the testing dataset. Finally, the model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This project offers insights into utilizing natural language processing techniques for stock market prediction.
